# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ React

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running React! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore React.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

This project was bootstrapped for you with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Vibes - Design System & UX Requirements:

### 1. Activity List Interface Enhancement
**Refined Prompt**: Implement a mobile-first activity timeline interface with expandable cards, similar to modern cloud service activity feeds. Each activity item should display date, description, and status in a compact row format with smooth expand/collapse animations for detailed notes and editing capabilities.

### 2. Dashboard Stats as Interactive Filter Buttons
**Refined Prompt**: Replace the traditional dashboard cards with a horizontal row of color-coded filter buttons integrated into the search/filter bar. Each button shows category name, uses semantic colors (e.g., red for overdue, green for completed), and displays count badges in the top-right corner. Active filters should have filled background, inactive should show outline style.

### 3. Advanced Filter Modal System
**Refined Prompt**: Create a comprehensive filter modal triggered by a filter icon button with badge notifications for active filter count. The modal should include text search, schedule cadence filtering, date range pickers, and other advanced criteria. Main search bar should be simplified to only show current filter summaries and reset functionality.

### 4. Toggle State Route Optimization
**Refined Prompt**: Convert the route optimization feature into a persistent toggle button with visual state indication (green filled when active, outline when inactive). The optimized order should remain applied until manually toggled off or new filters are applied.

### 5. Streamlined Scheduling Workflow
**Refined Prompt**: Implement a scheduling flow that returns directly to the main portal after date selection, automatically adding a "work scheduled" activity entry to the work order's activity timeline with appropriate status tracking.

### 6. Mobile-Optimized Activity Table
**Refined Prompt**: Design a responsive activity table with expandable rows, showing date, description, and status icons in the collapsed state. Expandable details should reveal notes, edit capabilities, and status management with smooth animations and touch-friendly controls.

### 7. Smart Next Due Date Logic
**Refined Prompt**: Implement intelligent next due date calculation based on incomplete scheduled activities, considering current date and cadence patterns to surface the most relevant upcoming work date.

### 8. Visual Schedule Indicators
**Refined Prompt**: Add visual scheduling hints to work order cards showing suggested next schedule dates based on cadence patterns, using subtle color coding and typography to guide user scheduling decisions.

### 9. Simplified Cadence Configuration
**Refined Prompt**: Streamline the cadence selection interface by removing day-of-week complexity, focusing on frequency patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) with cleaner modal layouts.

### 10. Modal Layout Standardization
**Refined Prompt**: Establish consistent modal design patterns with each form field on individual rows, proper spacing, clear hierarchy, and mobile-optimized touch targets for improved usability across all dialogs.

### Original Requirements (For Reference):

- After i click schedule and pick a date, i want to return back to the portal of work order cards.  I dont want to render the details modal.

- Cadence should only be my frequence selection. Remove status, day of week, and next due date inputs from this details section.

- Next Due Date will actually be changed to be a sub-text of the cadence selection which determines suggestion for next scheduled activity.  i.e.. get cadence selection and most recent activity date before now().  subtext will indicate the next sugggested activity date to be scheduled.

- The details modal should only have 1 row per label/input.  The label should be empbeded at the top of the input.  To conserve mobile ffriendly realestate on the web page.

- Activities should stretch the width of its parent modal.  With adequate padding.  The activities modal should allow me to edit the status.  When row is clicked, we will have modal allowing us to update date,  description , status.  And will have a list group of text items i can add or delete (trash icon).  I will use this as a list of reminders associated with that work activity.
